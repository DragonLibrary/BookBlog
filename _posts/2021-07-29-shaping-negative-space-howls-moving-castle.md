*Howl's Moving Castle* tells the tale of Sophie Hatter, a young woman cursed with age, who goes on a quest to regain her youth. She makes a deal with living fire, becomes the bane of a renowned and feared sorcerer's life, and grumbles about spiders. So why does this vivid fairytale have a clunky block font for its title, especially when contrasted with the beguiling swirls of the author's name? Because that thick, bold lettering provides an ideal backdrop for intriguing details to be placed within and around it.

Negative space in fonts is typically of a standard form- simple counters to differentiate letters in shape, and to aid in the contrast of that font's design. Nina Tara, the cover designer for this edition, uses it differently here. In addition to the standard shaping of the letters, Tara has excised illustrative outlines from the lettering. Ranging from the tiniest of spiders to the ominous and looming scarecrow, Tara treats the title like a backdrop or a layered stencil- something to be peeled off and added to to provide greater interest.

The title on the spine is the 'standardised' formatting, without additions. The typeface is block, monospaced print of two sizes (three on the cover itself) stacked on top of itself. Each letter is twice as tall as it is wide. The only contrast is in the counters of the Os,Ss and C), which narrows the bowls of those characters. Unusually for the genre, Tara settled for a very simple font. The design is more in fitting with the crime genre- which does fit with Howl's various investigative responsibilities and numerous personas. (One of which is reportedly a serial womaniser who ends relationships by eating his paramour.) But even this atypically bland typeface is decorated to be more fitting to the genre and therefore appeal to the target market.

Yet as is usual for books, the font on the cover has more detail than that of the spine. Tara shapes the characters through relief and excision of their black, adding illustration to the cover that draws the story out from the pages of the book and onto its cover. Here we can see silhouette excisions of the infamous bathroom, Calcifer's fireplace, and the door to many towns. It is the domestic clutter that resides within the lettering, contained within the title much as it is within the castle itself. The illustrative decorations above the title are far more dramatic, contextually, and relate to the climax of the novel, as if they have boiled over and escaped from the chimney's topping the title. But these decorative applications merely enhance the simple constructs of the lettering.

In contrast, the author's name is even more embellished than typical. The novelty typeface has swirls extending from every possible location on the name. Ascender, descender, serif, swash and terminal- no opportunity is spared is the typographers attempt
