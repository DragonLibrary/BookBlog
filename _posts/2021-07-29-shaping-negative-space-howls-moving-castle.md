*Howl's Moving Castle* tells the tale of Sophie Hatter, a young woman cursed with age, who goes on a quest to regain her youth. She makes a deal with living fire, becomes the bane of a renowned and feared sorcerer's life, and grumbles about spiders. So why does this vivid fairytale have a clunky block font for its title, especially when contrasted with the beguiling swirls of the author's name? Because that thick, bold lettering provides an ideal backdrop for intriguing details to be placed within and around it.

Negative space in fonts is typically of a standard form- simple counters to differentiate letters in shape, and to aid in the contrast of that font's design. Nina Tara, the cover designer for this edition, uses it differently here. In addition to the standard shaping of the letters, Tara has excised illustrative outlines from the lettering. Ranging from the tiniest of spiders to the ominous and looming scarecrow, Tara treats the title like a backdrop or a layered stencil- something to be peeled off and added to to provide greater interest.

The title on the spine is the 'standardised' formatting, without additions. The typeface is block, monospaced print of two sizes (three on the cover itself) stacked on top of itself. Each letter is twice as tall as it is wide. The only contrast is in the counters of the Os,Ss and C), which narrows the bowls of those characters.
