*Howl's Moving Castle* tells the tale of Sophie Hatter, a young woman cursed with age, who goes on a quest to regain her youth. She makes a deal with living fire, becomes the bane of a renowned and feared sorcerer's life, and grumbles about spiders. So why does this vivid fairytale have a clunky block font for its title, especially when contrasted with the beguiling swirls of the author's name? Because that thick, bold lettering provides an ideal backdrop for intriguing details to be placed within and around it.
