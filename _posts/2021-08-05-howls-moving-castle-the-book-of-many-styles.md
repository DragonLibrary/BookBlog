*Howl's Moving Castle* tells the tale of Sophie Hatter, a young woman cursed with age, who goes on a quest to regain her youth. She makes a deal with living fire, becomes the bane of a renowned and feared sorcerer's life, and grumbles about spiders. So why does this vivid fairytale have a clunky block font for its title, a dramatic and ornate swirl for the author's name, non-descript high contrast for the typeface, and enough illustrations for at least four less adorned covers? Why is it all details are black and white blocks on the purple-to-green gradient? Why are all illustrations simple silhouettes? Because, much as Jones combines simple commonplace elements of fairytales into something new, so cover designer Nina Tara creates a unique style only seen on the other books in the *Land of Ingary* series.

The font style use for the author's name is typical of the genre. The stark white shows clearly on the purple-to-green and is directly opposing all other features on the cover. It separates the author from all over components, like an omniscient cloud narrating Sophie's life, or an incredibly shaped wisp of smoke from the castle's chimney. Something above the story, yet present. The characters themselves are incredibly decorative, with each word having four to eight swirls.
