*Howl's Moving Castle* tells the tale of Sophie Hatter, a young woman cursed with age, who goes on a quest to regain her youth. She makes a deal with living fire, becomes the bane of a renowned and feared sorcerer's life, and grumbles about spiders. So why does this vivid fairytale have a clunky block font for its title, a dramatic and ornate swirl for the author's name, non-descript high contrast for the typeface, and enough illustrations for at least four less adorned covers? Why is it all details are black and white blocks on the purple-to-green gradient? Why are all illustrations simple silhouettes? Because, much as Jones combines simple commonplace elements of fairytales into something new, so cover designer Nina Tara creates a unique style only seen on the other books in the *Land of Ingary* series.

Only the font style use for the author's name is typical of the genre. The stark white shows clearly on the purple-to-green and is directly opposing all other features on the cover. It separates the author from all over components, like an omniscient cloud narrating Sophie's life, or an incredibly shaped wisp of smoke from the castle's chimney. Something above the story, yet present. The characters themselves are incredibly decorative, with each word having four to eight swirls. No opportunity is spared, as serifs and counters are just as liable as the traditional ascenders and descenders. The typeface is the only font on the cover that matches the fantastical and bizarre tone of the story, yet is bizarrely the second-least interesting feature of the design.

The smallest characters of the book is the tagline. As it proclaims, *Studio Ghibli* released an adaptation of the novel in November 2004, and had a positive reception among both the citizen and professional critics. This high-contrast serif font has a professional tone incongruous with the reverie of the plot and the no-nonsense attitude of Sophie's narration. Yet it does fit when considering the story as a fairytale. Similar fonts glimmer in gold, embossed on hardback covers from which Anderson, Grimm or Perrault lurk within among the beasts of lore. This small sized lettering also matches the styling of titles on numerous *Studio Ghibli* Miyazaki film covers, including popular *Spirited Away* and *Castle in the Sky*. Thus the choice for lettering is likely about matching tone to word while pairing with others of the genres.
