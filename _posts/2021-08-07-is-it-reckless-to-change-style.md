Cornelia Funke left the world of *Inkheart* and dreamt up Jacob Reckless' *MirrorWorld*. This land joins our own through windows, such as the mirror Reckless finds in his late father's study. It leads to a world of fairytales- but far more Grimm than Disney would want to get out. Goyls (presumably a derivation of the gargoyle), Bluebeards, kelpies, murderous unicorns, faeries (of old, with morals of their own, and punishments for betrayal), curses, enchantments, bespelled items and hexed trinkets. All this only a mirror away- provided you are brave- or reckless- enough to go through. Yet six years after its release, the *Reckless* series became the MirrorWorld, and its style underwent as much of a change as Jacob's reputation does when crossing worlds. How did this rebrand impact the covers? And, as the fourth novel peers through from November, is it still a reflection of the book?
