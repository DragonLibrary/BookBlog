Cornelia Funke left the world of *Inkheart* and dreamt up Jacob Reckless' *MirrorWorld*. This land joins our own through windows, such as the mirror Reckless finds in his late father's study. It leads to a world of fairytales- but far more Grimm than Disney would want to get out. Goyls (presumably a derivation of the gargoyle), Bluebeards, kelpies, murderous unicorns, faeries (of old, with morals of their own, and punishments for betrayal), curses, enchantments, bespelled items and hexed trinkets. All this only a mirror away- provided you are brave- or reckless- enough to go through. Yet six years after its release, the *Reckless* series became the MirrorWorld, and its style underwent as much of a change as Jacob's reputation does when crossing worlds. How did this rebrand impact the covers? And, as the fourth novel peers through from November, is it still a reflection of the book?

Upon its release in 2010, Funke had two separate hardbacks released. One with Little Brown, featuring the Goyl-jade skin of Will, gazing back at the viewer from the mirror through which the curse resides; the other, from Chicken House, fixes golden-amber eyes upon the reader from the glimmer of marble-like skin, the expression seemingly that of prey both angered and panicked. Then yet another cover was created for the 2013 paperback editions following the release of its sequel *Fearless*. So with two books and an assortment of covers to choose from, what happened? Why the about-face to this?

According to *The Bookseller*, Funke moved from Chicken House (and US counterpoint Little Brown) to Pushkin Press based on editorial disputes regarding the third novel. As a result, the novel was transferred to new teams with new ideas, inspirations and tastes. These new covers and titles are likely a result. The Pushkin team redesigned the books of Lionel Wigram's translations of Funke's work into English in order to stamp their own mark on them in preparation for the continuation of the series and create a fresh start with Funke and her works. It may also have been necessary if the cover designers or the original team were less willing to share and pass-over their works.

So, with an idea of the why this reshaping of the paratext occurred, it is the time to consider if this was a good decision and how it has shaped impressions of the book.

When placed side-by-side, the differences are apparent. The colour palette and illustrations are completely distinct, and the typography of the title is disparate. Yet despite this, there are also certain elements that go unchanged. Although the colouring of the lettering changes, the typeface itself is consistent for Funke's name. This is likely to match the typeface used for her name on her other novels to have some form of consistency across her works; editions of numerous titles, including *Inkheart*, *Dragon Rider* and *Igraine The Brave* all featured this particular font. The consistency is part of the presentation of Funke as an author, so remains similar, if not identical, across multiple aspects of her portfolio. 

Comparing the titles, another difference is evident. The names are dramatically altered. *Reckless* goes from an embossed scrawl, as if from a messy writer with a quill, to delicately serifed, all-caps monospace for *The Petrified Flesh*. It could be argued that this change is to suit the new title and pair with the blend of delicacy and brutality of the thorn butterfly (or, more likely, a moth as the Fairy uses in the book). This also suits the disparity of the title, with flesh becoming stone as Will's does, and as human becomes Goyl. With this in mind, the changing of the font for Reckless to pair with that of the title and author's name makes more sense. Again, it is about cohesion in the style and presentation. The bold, all-caps, staggered sizing of Reckless is attention grabbing, albeit in a different manner to that of the original. It is not ostentatious but it refuses to fade into the background. The contrast in sizing between title and series name is similar to that between the brothers bearing that name. Jacob is confrontational and, as the surname suggests, rather reckless; Will is unassuming in his manner and presentation, and despite his gradual metamorphosis, he remains overlooked in the book in favour of the subdued flamboyance of Jacob's adventuring attitude. It also keeps the focus centred on the series, the world and its protagonist rather than on the individual story of its first book.
