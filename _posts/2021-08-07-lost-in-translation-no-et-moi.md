People often compare British and American book covers, comparing their colouring, imagery, type and X. So how do French and English covers compare? Delphine De Vigan's *No et Moi* is a touching emotional story about intelligent but lonely young adolescent Lou Bertignac and her efforts to help homeless older girl Nolwenn get back on her feet. Lou struggles to support No while her parents mourn her deceased sibling and No battles with her mental health. This realistic and optimistically narrated tale won the Prix des Libraires in 2008, contributing to the creation of its film adaptation in 2010. So how do the native French and UK translation covers differ, and how do they represent the story?

France's *Le Livre de Poche* imprint will serve as the country's representative. The design is simple and lacks decorative elements. A photograph, presumably from the film adaption, serves as background and focal point. No and Lou stare at something offscreen, in matching knit hats. No is in focus in the foreground, looking up. Meanwhile Lou's blurred face is in the background, head craned slightly to see what No sees. The two cover the page as they fill and guide the plot of le roman. Other than the necessary text to identify title and author, the only other adornment is the imprint logo in the bottom corner. Of the text, the two typefaces contrast greatly.

*No et Moi* is a simple, sans-serif capitalised type in pink. It is reminiscent of a font to be used in the presentation Lou is working to at the book's beginning, as if De Vigan borrowed the character's working title for her book. Or perhaps it is how she imagines Lou catalogues their time together in her head. Either way, this simple declarative title rests beneath De Vigan's name in a typeface that makes the directness of the title and the story narration in its lack of frill. It suits the straightforward, socially awkward and inquisitive style of Lou's narration of events. The pink of the title (hexcode e4056f) is similar to that of Lou's scarf, and the blurred pink behind De Vigan's name. Much like the eponymous characters, it is both a statement and background colour. No is a member of *les sans domicile fixe,* a feature of the cityscape that is intentionally ignored, accidentally overlooked, or charitably assisted. Lou is a quiet, intellectually precocious, socially awkward child with a difficult family life. Both characters are in the odd state of standing out as unusual and blending into the background- just like this shade of pink. So every aspect of the title suits the characters named in it, and therefore pairs well with the story.

De Vigan's name is more elaborate, but still not particularly excessive, and contrasts greatly against that of the title. The sizing changes for each word, as if building up to De Vigan's final name. The weight is varied, with certain strokes (such as the of the V) being as slender as the serifs while others (including the bowl of the Ds) are at least treble the thickness. Contrast, in this typeface, provides a more 'traditionally French' (to this Brit) aesthetic.  This combination also creates a more sophisticated tone than that of the story. Combining this with the colouring of De Vigan's lettering, a stark white (hexcode fafff8), the author is distinct from both story and novel. She, and the brand logo in the corner, are the anomalous elements, as they do not exist as part of the narrative but as the paratext and context.

As with the markets, the British cover differs greatly from the French. This Bloomsbury ebook edition is again one simple image (possibly an edited photograph?), but the English one has far more extraneous text, and some very different typefaces. Even the blurb changes significantly between the original and the translation.

Beginning the comparison is the image. Here, the focal image is a place rather than people. The blurb features the train station where No and Lou meet, with the cover reflecting this location. The lamppost
