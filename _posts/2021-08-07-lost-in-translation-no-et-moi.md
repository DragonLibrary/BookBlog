People often compare British and American book covers, comparing their colouring, imagery, type and X. So how do French and English covers compare? Delphine De Vigan's *No et Moi* is a touching emotional story about intelligent but lonely young adolescent Lou Bertignac and her efforts to help homeless older girl Nolwenn get back on her feet. Lou struggles to support No while her parents mourn her deceased sibling and No battles with her mental health. This realistic and optimistically narrated tale won the Prix des Libraires in 2008, contributing to the creation of its film adaptation in 2010. So how do the native French and UK translation covers differ, and how do they represent the story?

France's *Le Livre de Poche* imprint will serve as the country's representative. The design is simple and lacks decorative elements. A photograph, presumably from the film adaption, serves as background and focal point. No and Lou stare at something offscreen, in matching knit hats. No is in focus in the foreground, looking up. Meanwhile Lou's blurred face is in the background, head craned slightly to see what No sees. The two cover the page as they fill and guide the plot of le roman. Other than the necessary text to identify title and author, the only other adornment is the imprint logo in the bottom corner. Of the text, the two typefaces contrast greatly.

*No et Moi* is a simple, sans-serif capitalised type in pink. It is reminiscent of a font to be used in the presentation Lou is working to at the book's beginning, as if De Vigan borrowed the character's working title for her book. Or perhaps it is how she imagines Lou catalogues their time together in her head. Either way, this simple declarative title rests beneath De Vigan's name in a typeface that makes the directness of the title and the story narration in its lack of frill. It suits the straightforward, socially awkward and inquisitive style of Lou's narration of events.
