Marissa Meyer wrote *The Lunar Chronicles* as a reimagining of classic and beloved childhood. But the tales of Grimm received upgrades and cybernetic prosthetics in this version. On 126 T.E.'s Earth, Cinderella is a cyborg, Scarlett rides spaceships, Cress orbits Earth in a spy satellite, and Winter is an insane princess on the moon. Meyer merges classical fairytales and sci-fi tropes into a stunning series that explores what it means to be human, even when you aren't.
