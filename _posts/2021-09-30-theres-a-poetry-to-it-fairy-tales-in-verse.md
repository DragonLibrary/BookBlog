Once upon a time, people began to tell fairy tales... and they never stopped. Short stories, allegories, folk tales,  myths, fables. The list goes on, and we today continue to evolve this as new forms of technology become increasingly accessible. But one of the oldest is the poem, the briefer cousin of epic ballads such as *Beowulf*. Public perception of poetry shifts, ranging from elitist to dismissive. So how is a fairy tale changed when it takes on a poetic format?

*Fierce Fairytales* by Nikita Gill takes the traditional stories of childhood and retells them from alternative perspectives. The narratives humanise villains and return autonomy to previously passive or foolish protagonists. Captain Hook is seeking revenge for a callous teenage heartbreak; The Hatter's madness was induced by gaslighting; the princess was put in the tower to prevent her becoming the dragon. Gill takes classics of fairy tales and shapes them into feminist narrations. This fits the current trends of casting older stories in the moulds of contemporary ideals and perspectives, as well as that of retelling the stories from the antagonist's perspectives. The stories are shortened by this format, but still comparatively long when framed in context of the original pieces. And Gill inserts far more emotion into the narrative than the centuries-old versions. The stories become more personal and emotive than their inspirations. This is true of other works in the same position, be it her original stories or those of contemporary poets.

Take Duffy, for example. *The World's Wife* reimagines the female partners of famous men and tells the story from their, often rolling, eyes. The poet laureate's 1999 collection has been studied for A-Levels in the mid-2000s, and continues in educational relevance with *Feminine Gospel* succeeding it on the syllabus.

* Pick a couple of specifics to go over, and talk over it generally.
* Any major trends in the book. Can I link it to other examples (e.g. any similar stories to Gill or Lovelace?)

Some authors, as Gill did, then use these tropes as a foundation for their own work in imagery and plots, either to make in relevant or to subvert it for effect.

* Talk about Lovelace's fairy tale collection series.
* Look into themes she pulls out in the collection.
* How is she subverting the story.

And it isn't just the published writers that reimagine fairy tales that use the poem format. The [poem below](https://fioren-nights.tumblr.com/post/128616392320) is from Tumblr user fioren-nights and reimagines the classical trope of princess rescued from a dragon in a castle. The blogger considers how the narrative of the story would change if the slayed dragon were to be a beloved companion of the princess.

The poem remains fairly similar in phrasing and style to standard storytelling, but adopts a number of modern internet poetry themes. The lack of typical capitalisation despite caesura; longer sentences than that of prose; use of standard, conversational lexicon rather than more formal specialist lexicon. All of these appear commonly in Instagram poetry as aspects of the genre.

But how does this work in the more historical fairy tales? *The Goblin Market* is the most known poem of the genre, with Rossetti's 1862 work continuing to be republished even now. It is far longer than traditional fairy tale formats, and dedicates far more of itself to descriptive listing text and direct speech than the works of the genre keystone authors. Rossetti's protagonist dedicates herself to common sense in the face of foolishness- first in the reckless actions of her sister to eat the fairy food, then in the face of malevolent mischief within the market when she herself enters in order to save her sister from the fate brought about by said food. This too is both novel and staple, as wise actions are common within fairy tales, though not as standard as one would hope. This in-detail sensory description, particularly of the visuals around them, sets it apart from prose pieces that are far more condensed in length so must focus more on the plot's action than the setting.
