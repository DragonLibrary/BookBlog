Once upon a time, people began to tell fairy tales... and they never stopped. Short stories, allegories, folk tales,  myths, fables. The list goes on, and we today continue to evolve this as new forms of technology become increasingly accessible. But one of the oldest is the poem, the briefer cousin of epic ballads such as *Beowulf*. Public perception of poetry shifts, ranging from elitist to dismissive. So how is a fairy tale changed when it takes on a poetic format?

*The Goblin Market* is a classical fairy tale poem. Rosetti published it in 1862, and it continues to be republished even now. It is far longer than traditional fairy tale formats, and dedicates far more of itself to descriptive listing text and direct speech than the works of the genre keystone authors. Rossetti's protagonist dedicates herself to common sense in the face of foolishness- first in the reckless actions of her sister to eat the fairy food, then in the face of malevolent mischief within the market when she herself enters in order to save her sister from the fate brought about by said food. This too is both novel and staple, as wise actions are encouraged within fairy tales, though not standard, as one would hope. This in-detail sensory description, particularly of the visuals around them, sets it apart from prose pieces that are far more condensed in length so must focus more on the plot's action than the setting. It also better matched the lexicon of the 'original' works, as it is far nearer chronologically and socially than that of modern poetry. [Roe's 2014 analysis](https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/an-introduction-to-goblin-market) identifies it as an "experimental form" due to intentional inconsistencies in style and meter, with long numerous stanzas. The tale becomes more immersive than the classical fairy tales due to the details Rossetti was able to insert that would have been sacrificed had it been a prose piece at the peak of fairy tale chronicling a century earlier. Yet it is distinctly divergent from its contemporary cousins in fairy tale poetry.

*Fierce Fairytales* by Nikita Gill takes the traditional stories of childhood and retells them from alternative perspectives. The narratives humanise villains and return autonomy to previously passive or foolish protagonists. Captain Hook is seeking revenge for a callous teenage heartbreak; The Hatter's madness was induced by gaslighting; the princess was put in the tower to prevent her becoming the dragon. Gill takes classics of fairy tales and shapes them into feminist narrations. This fits the current trends of casting older stories in the moulds of contemporary ideals and perspectives, as well as that of retelling the stories from the antagonist's perspectives. The stories are shortened by this format, but still comparatively long when framed in context of the original pieces. And Gill inserts far more emotion into the narrative than the centuries-old versions. Rossetti, for example, had little emotion in the telling despite the violence of the text. Her language places you as observer rather than empath, watching rather than experiencing Laura's longing and Lizzie's suffering. Gill's stories become more personal and emotive than their inspirations. This is true of other works in the same position, be it original stories or those of contemporary poets.

Duffy examines fairy tales in another, more emotive, manner as well. *The World's Wife* reimagines the female partners of famous men and tells the story from their, often rolling, eyes. The poet laureate's 1999 collection has been studied for A-Levels in the mid-2000s, and continues in educational relevance with *Feminine Gospel* succeeding it on the syllabus. It opens with *Little Red-Cap*, a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood that returns it the category of being a warning about men and links to the modern versions of reclaiming and protecting the wilder aspects of femininity, as Gill's poem on the tale did. Here, our protagonist hunts down the wolf, aware of what he is, to capture and shape her poetry and revel in the beauty of words as she grows from "babe, waif" to a woman capable of killing and independence. Near the end is *Mrs Beast*, not Beauty. This powerful woman, riding to the castle under her own steam with independent wealth, plays poker with other notable brides, dominating in her relationship with the Beast, who serves her quietly and gratefully. She mourns the dead, unhappy women of other fairytales, reminding herself that night that she will be the less desperate on in her relationship. Duffy's fairytales allude to far more of the real than Gill, using these fairytales and myths and historical women to encapsulate womanhood and provide her own perspective on how "behind every great man is a strong woman". Though only two of these are fairy tales, Duffy

Amanda Lovelace, another poet who transitioned from internet to traditional publishing, also use these tropes as a foundation for her own work in imagery and plots, either to make in relevant or to subvert it for effect. The fairytale imagery lingers throughout her works, especially the *women are some kind of magic* collection from Andrews Mcmeel Publushing in 2016-19. The big bad wolf, the evil queen, dragons and mermaids and princesses and mirrors and flowers and towers and shapeshifting all appear in her first collection *the princess saves herself in this one*. Yet Lovelace makes a point to clarify that these are not fairy tales. Her lengthy trigger warning forewarns of the dark content explored far more vividly and more emotive language than traditional tales. The wolf won't eat you, but they will consume you whole. The mother is the evil queen, but you miss her at the end of the story because you're human. The prince can't save you, and sometimes he doesn't even try. The sections of 'the princess', 'the damsel', 'the queen' and 'you' also suit the growth of Lovelace. This book is an stylised autobiography reliant on the shaping of internet poetry, where she grew her audience, and the fairytale tropes used to make it more bearable and connect with the audience while attempting to dissociate from the nightmares. Nothing but the names are a fantasy. Yet fairy tales still influences everything in this books from the words on the cover to the phrasing of the poems to the titles on almost every page. Fairy tales in poetry moved beyond reimagining the classics into an outlet and mode of connection between creator and audience.

And it isn't just the published writers that reimagine fairy tales that use the poem format. The [poem below](https://fioren-nights.tumblr.com/post/128616392320) is from Tumblr user fioren-nights and reimagines the classical trope of princess rescued from a dragon in a castle. The blogger considers how the narrative of the story would change if the slayed dragon were to be a beloved companion of the princess.

The poem remains fairly similar in phrasing and style to standard storytelling, but adopts a number of modern internet poetry themes. The lack of typical capitalisation despite caesura; longer sentences than that of prose; use of standard, conversational lexicon rather than more formal specialist lexicon. All of these appear commonly in Instagram poetry as aspects of the genre.
