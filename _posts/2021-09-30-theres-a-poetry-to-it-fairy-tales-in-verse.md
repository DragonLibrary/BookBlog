Once upon a time, people began to tell fairy tales... and they never stopped. Short stories, allegories, folk tales,  myths, fables. The list goes on, and we today continue to evolve this as new forms of technology become increasingly accessible. But one of the oldest is the poem, the briefer cousin of epic ballads such as *Beowulf*. Public perception of poetry shifts, ranging from elitist to dismissive. So how is a fairy tale changed when it takes on a poetic format?

*Fierce Fairytales* by Nikita Gill takes the traditional stories of childhood and retells them from alternative perspectives. The narratives humanise villains and return autonomy to previously passive or foolish protagonists. Captain Hook is seeking revenge for a callous teenage heartbreak; The Hatter's madness was induced by gaslighting; the princess was put in the tower to prevent her becoming the dragon. Gill takes classics of fairy tales and shapes them into feminist narrations. This fits the current trends of casting older stories in the moulds of contemporary ideals and perspectives, as well as that of retelling the stories from the antagonist's perspectives. The stories are shortened by this format, but still comparatively long when framed in context of the original pieces. And Gill inserts far more emotion into the narrative than the centuries-old versions. The stories become more personal and emotive than their inspirations. This is true of other works in the same position, be it her original stories or those of contemporary poets.

Take Duffy, for example. *The World's Wife* reimagines the female partners of famous men and tells the story from their, often rolling, eyes. The poet laureate's 1999 collection has been studied for A-Levels in the mid-2000s, and continues in educational relevance with *Feminine Gospel* succeeding it on the syllabus.

* Pick a couple of specifics to go over, and talk over it generally.
* Any major trends in the book. Can I link it to other examples (e.g. any similar stories to Gill or Lovelace?)

Some authors, as Gill did, then use these tropes as a foundation for their own work in imagery and plots, either to make in relevant or to subvert it for effect.

* Talk about Lovelace's fairy tale collection series.
* Look into themes she pulls out in the collection.
* How is she subverting the story.

And it isn't just the published writers that use fairy tales as basis for their story.
