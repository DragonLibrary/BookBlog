Once upon a time, people began to tell fairy tales... and they never stopped. Short stories, allegories, folk tales,  myths, fables. The list goes on, and we today continue to evolve this as new forms of technology become increasingly accessible. But one of the oldest is the poem, the briefer cousin of epic ballads such as *Beowulf*. Public perception of poetry shifts, ranging from elitist to dismissive. So how is a fairy tale changed when it takes on a fairy tale format?

*Fierce Fairytales* by Nikita Gill takes the traditional stories of childhood and retells them from alternative perspectives. The narratives humanise villains and return autonomy to previously passive or foolish protagonists. Captain Hook is seeking revenge for a callous teenage heartbreak; The Hatter's madness was induced by gaslighting; the princess was put in the tower to prevent her becoming the dragon. Gill takes classics of fairy tales and shapes them into feminist narrations. This fits the current trends of casting older stories in the moulds of contemporary ideals and perspectives, as well as that of retelling the stories from the antagonist's perspectives
