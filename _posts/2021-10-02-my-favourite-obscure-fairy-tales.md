There are so many fairy tales in existence, it is unlikely there is anyone in existence knows them all. Many will know the classics, ranging from the staples of European collectors like the Grimms and Perrault to the staples of the *Thousand and One Nights* anthologies. But there are some that rarely make it into retellings. This is a shame, as there are a multitude of incredible stories that deserve far more attention than they currently receive.
