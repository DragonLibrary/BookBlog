There are so many fairy tales in existence, it is unlikely there is anyone in existence knows them all. Many will know the classics, ranging from the staples of European collectors like the Grimms and Perrault to the staples of the *Thousand and One Nights* anthologies. But there are some that rarely make it into retellings. This is a shame, as there are a multitude of incredible stories that deserve far more attention than they currently receive. So here are some fairy tales rarely discussed* in the United Kingdom.

**1. Diamonds and Toads**

A story by Charles Perrault. A widow with two daughters, each taking on the personality of a parent. Their opposing views cause matching responses from fairies seeking assistance. This contains many of the staples of classical fairy tales: an evil mother, a spoilt sister, a magical being that enacts karma, and a marriage that saves the good child from the terrible nature of her home life. But unlike a number of Perrault's other works, this one remains in relative obscurity.

**2. The Lady of the Elves**

Collected by Jon Arnason, an Icelandic scholar from the nineteenth century.



\*Disclaimer: This is based on personal experience; it may simply be that they are not commonly discussed around me, rather than simply being less spoken of.
