There are few people who are unaware of the story of Sleeping Beauty, a gorgeous princess cursed to death and saved by changing that to a death-like slumber. There are mto any versions of it, yet the most popular tend to be the most frustrating. The young woman lives a calm life before accidentally pricking herself, to fall into the sleep and be awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince. But the number of inconsistencies in this are frustratingly numerous and get more troublesome the more thought is put into it.

Disney's prolificate nature means the story living in public consciousness came to be in 1959. Princess is raised away from the palace in hiding from the curse, falls in love with a boy she met once and barely spoke to, pricks her finger, kingdom is put to sleep, boy is a prince who fights a dragon to reach her and kiss her to break the curse, and they all live happily ever after. Yay! Except, no. No yay. No joy. No good plot. Disney cut the story in half and then shook it up into this version far different from its seventeenth century counterpart.

Perrault's story begins the same way. The princess is cursed by a fairy. Not out of spite, but out of a major social faux-pas in failing to invite the thirteenth fairy despite inviting twelve others. Baby princess is given an assortment of blessings, and cursed to death that is shifted to a century of sleep. The princess lives in the palace, and prick her finger on a wheel in the castle after trying to learn to spin. The fairy puts the castle to sleep, but leaves the King and Queen awake to rule the rest of the kingdom. A prince fights his way through the weeds around the castle to reach the princess, just as she awakens from her hundred years sleep and the castle comes to life. The two secretly marry and have two children before the four of them go to the prince's home. The queen, who is part ogress, requests each member of her son's family be killed and cooked for her dinner, one by one. She is instead tricked into eating other meat, which she consumes with relish. Upon discovery of the truth through unfortunate coincidence, the queen arranges for a giant vat of beasts be prepared for the three of them to be thrown into. When her son arrives and stops the execution of his family, the queen throws herself into the vat and dies. And they all (worryingly) live happily ever after after all.

Both versions have problems. Dubious consent, falling in love at first sight, an evil fairy using personal slights as reasoning to hurt an uninvolved newborn baby. But the Disney one frustrates me in a way Perrault's does not.
