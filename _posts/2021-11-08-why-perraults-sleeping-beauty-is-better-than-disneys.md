There are few people who are unaware of the story of Sleeping Beauty, a gorgeous princess cursed to death and saved by changing that to a death-like slumber. There are many versions of it, yet the most popular tend to be the most frustrating. A peaceful life unaware of impending doom cut short by the only decision she seems to make in the entire story. She awakens and immediately enters a serious romantic relationship with a total stranger. Yet we know very little about her as a person or character, because she lacks something vital to any major character. And that is agency.

Sleeping Beauty's story is quite well known. Be she Aurora, Briar Rose, or unnamed, she remains a beautiful, graceful, blessed young woman. But nothing is said about her as an individual. Is she clever? Brave? Hardworking? Does she have a favourite food or colour? Does she have any pets? Friends? Is she close with her parents? We know none of these things in the main three versions (Perrault, Grimm and Disney). Her defining traits are the name of the story- she is a beauty cursed to sleep. The eponymous character is the least active of the story, and that makes her the most frustrating fairy tale princess.
