There are few people who are unaware of the story of Sleeping Beauty, a gorgeous princess cursed to death and saved by changing that to a death-like slumber. There are many versions of it, yet the most popular tend to be the most frustrating. The young woman lives a calm life before accidentally pricking herself, to fall into the sleep and be awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince. But the number of inconsistencies in this are frustratingly numerous and get more troublesome the more thought is put into it.

Disney's prolificate nature means the story living in public consciousness came to be in 1959. Princess is raised away from the palace in hiding from the curse, falls in love with a boy she met once and barely spoke to, pricks her finger, kingdom is put to sleep, boy is a prince who fights a dragon to reach her and kiss her to break the curse, and they all live happily ever after. Yay! Except, no. No yay. No joy. No good plot. Disney cut the story in half and then shook it up into this version far different from its seventeenth century counterpart.

Perrault's story begins the same way. The princess is cursed by a fairy. Not out of spite, but out of a major social faux-pas in failing to invite the thirteenth fairy despite inviting twelve others.
