There are few people who are unaware of the story of Sleeping Beauty, a gorgeous princess cursed to death and saved by changing that to a death-like slumber. There are many versions of it, yet the most popular tend to be the most frustrating. The young woman lives a calm life before accidentally pricking herself, to fall into the sleep and be awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince. But the number of inconsistencies in this are frustratingly numerous and get more troublesome the more thought is put into it.

Disney's prolificate nature means the story living in public consciousness came to be in 1959. The death promised by Maleficent was hindered by the next fairy, to make it a sleep broken by True Love's Kiss. The King and Queen send baby princess away to be raised by others, and all spinning wheels are destroyed in an effort to avert this disaster.
