*Don't judge a book by its cover* is a popular adage, but why? True, it reflects well the thought that superficial damage does not define or diminish value, but it doesn't always work. Cover designers work hard to construct works that reflect a story and captures the attention of its target audience. It may not always work, but there is effort put into a book's appearance. So, this theory will be put to the test. I will pick a book based solely on its cover. Not its blurb. Just the front cover of the paperback.
