Last year, Bella Pearson of Guppy Books agreed to an interview with me for a case study I was doing on a publishing house. The resulting document was an overview of her business and an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses as a company is the children's trade fiction sector. 

This is a recently updated version, edited to include title successes since that interview.
