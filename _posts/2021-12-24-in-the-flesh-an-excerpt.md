“Inhale. Exhale. Hold on tight, and take that next step.” Though the voice and words were gentle, they grated on my brain as I adjusted my grip on the bars. My right hand felt wrong as I flexed it. Alien. The doctors said that was to be expected, that it would be odd if it didn’t, that I would adjust. Meaningless, generic platitudes. They didn’t help me, but the physiotherapists and neurologists and psychiatrists and mechanics and dermatologists and the, what felt like, thirty other specialisms I’d seen in the past months couldn’t seem to come up with anything better to say.

Knuckles turning white at the strain, I slowly raised my right leg to take a step forward. The movement was gradual but weighted. I focused on placing the− my, I had to remember it was mine now− my foot on the floor carefully. My ankle tried to roll slightly underneath me as I settled weight on it, but I managed to hold firm as I set it on the ground.

“Well done Quinn. The connections are holding well. Your nerve therapist will be pleased the integration has sustained this level of completion. Now again, inhale, exhale−” The voice continued.

“Please mute optional audio.” I cut in, eyes darting to the camera in the medical droid’s head. Silence fell as my breath sagged out of me. Inhale. Exhale. Lift your left foot and−

Leg gone. Strange pain. Deep breath. The droid’s hand had caught me in the armpit and held me upright even as my gaze fell to my prosthetic. Chrome glimmered in the glare of the lighting, mocking me. Its weight skewed my balance, the angle off as I looked down on it. Eight months since my accident. Eight months and I still couldn’t use the damn replacement. At least I could stand on it now. That was an improvement. And I was getting better at ignoring the itching on the compression bandage around the joint.

“Help me over to the bench. I think I felt a screw twist in the ankle.” The droid supported me as I moved to the seating by the wall. The lack of expression had phased people back when the machines were first introduced, but now they accepted them as a routine part of medicine. I sometimes regretted my decision to go with automated support, but I couldn’t handle the way the nurses in the hospital had looked at me soon after the accident. The gentleness in their eyes as they helped me back onto the bad after I refused to believe that parts of me were gone. The way they pretended not to see when I cried after it finally settled in what I’d lost.

The droid passed me the screwdriver and I began to tweak on of the screws slightly until the pop echoed through. The engineer on site had painstakingly talked me through basic maintenance once the integration first went through. After I stopped biting people, convinced that if they meddled with it the throbbing pulsing up from the joint would somehow worsen. Maybe that was why they agreed to let me go android-based for my treatment. Dents tend not to impede movement like bruising does. They hadn’t expected that severe a reaction; none of the others on the study had experienced that feeling when their cybernetics were installed. The hand had gone far more smoothly. It moved, but felt more like it was triggering switches in my head than the effortless motion of ripple my ‘previous’ hand had. Another suggestion from the medical staff. *Try not to think of it as something you lost; think of it as a replacement, or even an upgrade.* Maybe one day I would take that advice. Not today though. Not when they still failed me and the doctors continued to swap out parts. *Just another tweak. This one will make it faster. Smoother. Better*.

“You’ll damage the part if you continue to adjust it in that manner. Please desist or specify your goal for assistance.”

The voice jerked me from my thoughts, bringing awareness to what I had been doing. In my thoughts, the hand had been twisting the screw to the point of breaking. It seemed to do that a fair amount. The troubleshooting team theorised that when the hand lacked active commands, it resorted to the last set movement, like how a piano carries it notes after the key has been struck, or how you fidget with something when occupied with another task. But it felt wrong.

These casual movements were meant to make the hand seem more organic before skin was printed on it. It felt more like an organism living attached to me, somewhere between symbiosis and parasite. A being of programming, wiring and 3D printing rather than flesh and organic carbon. An unknown trying to quietly assimilate into my life. Those working in the cybernetics division had told me that I would be accustomed to it. Another useless placation. Despite numerous requests, the function was not being removed or deactivated.

“If you have completed maintenance on your ankle, we should continue your session. Your recovery plan states you should walk this path twice more before you leave. These are your final two exercises before stretches.” I studied at the droid. After trying and trying ever since the accident I still couldn’t figure out if it was the same droid each time. Wasn’t even sure where the voice came out. Certainly not the head. Maybe somewhere in the neck…

“Quinn, we must return to your exercises.”

Sighing, I stood up. My arm chilled on the casing as it assisted me to the frame. Hands once again tight on the rails, bracing myself. Deep inhale. Weight shifted to the right. Left foot lifts, gradually, arms ready to catch me, oh-so-aware of the droid lurking ‘supportively’ behind me, limb padding faded but undeniably thick. Toes come off the ground, all weight balanced on the mild buzzing, niggling feel of the leg. The joints didn’t creak− *Far too well designed*, the engineer had sniffed during my initial questions. Yet I always heard something when it bore weight. And the buzzing trickle of electricity as it went from nerve cell to wire alternated between immersion in ice and a scorch reminiscent of the crash that ‘gifted’ me those new appendages. Gritted teeth began to grind as I completed the laborious tasks to walk to the end and back. Though it wasn’t touching me, I could feel the chill of the droid’s limbs behind me.

“Well done, your assigned exercises are complete. Please do your assigned stretches before departure. Your next appointment time will be forwarded to you for confirmation.”

The droid handed me a towel to wipe down with, then turned to clean the railings and activate the mop-bot. I used the supports to make it over to the mats where I began my stretches. As I completed the prescribed motions, my mind wandered once again to everything that had changed since the accident. The loss of my body parts and subsequent problems with mobility; losing my job and having to change accommodations from access limits; and that constant nagging that my body was no longer solely mine. That, in the aftermath, the new parts had replaced something vital and nothing would ever be the same again within me. Something had snuck in and embedded itself inextricably. And that it would continue to grow until I was no longer me.

The psychiatrist had dismissed this concern. Oh, the doctor talked about how my identity was different, but my ‘essence’ remained unchanged. But they couldn’t feel the cybernetics in them. They had worked with the prosthetics company for years, were respected for their work with amputees. Their understanding was intellectual and analytical. It failed to comprehend the truth of what I felt within my own body. Many an internal argument had been had about the nature of paranoia after a traumatic event, but nothing had changed. That creeping, insidious sense of otherness persisted. Lingered. Grew.

I clipped on my leg brace and moved towards the door, only to be stopped by the voice.

“Quinn, it has been noted that your recovery is being impeded due to a lack of mental integration with your cybernetics. Your recovery plan has been updated to include additional meetings with neurology and mechanics to rectify this problem. Please state your understanding for confirmation.”

The cybernetic hand played against what little organic thigh remained, tracing the edges of the brace as it went. I forced it to settle at my side.

“I understand the alteration to my medical care plans. When will this meeting occur?”

“The consultation will be scheduled following your next psychological appointment. It has been requested that your psychiatrist attend the meeting to confirm if your mental state could be impacting your progress. Please confirm your agreement with this.”

Mechanic, neurologist, psychiatrist. Of the doctors I had seen since the accident, these had been most resistant to my concerns. And would be in the best position to adjust the settings on the devices to eradicate this gnawing sense of wrong that gradually ate at my limbs.

“I understand the parameters of this meeting. Please send the appointment to my planner.”
