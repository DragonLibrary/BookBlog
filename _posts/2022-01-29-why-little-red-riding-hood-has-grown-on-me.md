Once upon a time a little girl went into the woods, disobeyed her mother, resulting in her and her grandmother being eaten by the wolf. Or did she?

Fairy tales are wonderfully versatile and multi-faceted. They are shaped by each storyteller sharing them and evolve as popular variations gradually eclipse the previous iteration. Today, of the many versions of Little Red Riding Hood, the general populace typically thinks of the nineteenth-century edition printed by the Grimms, in which a foolish girl and her frail grandmother are rescued by a passing huntsman who cuts them from the wolf's stomach. (Though they tend to leave off the second wolf who follows the young girl and is drowned during an attempted break-in through the chimney.) This was not always the case however.

Folklorists have been saying for several years that it is likely this tale was originally quite different, and was likely a story of a rite of passage for girls as they became women. Angela Carter has this version written out in the back of *The Virago Book of Fairy Tales*, discussing how the girl chooses between the path of needles and path of pins to reach her ailing grandmother. Meanwhile the Wolf takes the shorter path to reach the house and enter using the latched door in order to consume the elder. Red comes along and is told to eat the meat and wine stored in the cupboards- which is actually the blood and flesh of her recently deceased grandmother. The wolf then tells her to strip, throw her clothes into the fire, and join him in bed. The traditional speech of "Oh Grandma, what large X you have" ensues, at the end of which Red realises this is not her dear sickly relative. The protagonist then insists on going to the bathroom, which the Wolf tries to insist she do in the bed, before relenting and tying her to a tree outside to prevent escape. Red gets free and runs to safety, the Wolf realising his mistake too late to catch his prey. So how did she go from clever youth drawing strength and wisdom from her grandmother to a clueless treat for a predator?

In seventeenth-century France, fairy tales were undergoing a transformation thanks to the salons, centres of civilised intellectual debate that often revolved around storytelling. Despite the prevalence of female tellers at large and in these circles, the most prominent remains Charles Perrault, who we can blame for this shift in representation. He wrote it as a warning for girls and women to beware of the wolf, who would consume girls whenever possible despite the noble huntsmen nearby. The moral added to the end clearly frames it to be a lesson taught to avoid the ruining and rape of those young women entering society who may come in contact with such a wolf. 

This sexual undertone imitates the stripping she performs in the older version, yet often exaggerated in modern media. This sexualisation has spread through literature, advertisement, film. Even when the young girl is not alluring, as in the first episode of *Grimm*, she is still viewed as an object of lust despite the deviant criminal association of it.
