Once upon a time a little girl went into the woods, disobeyed her mother, resulting in her and her grandmother being eaten by the wolf. Or did she?

Fairy tales are wonderfully versatile and multi-faceted. They are shaped by each storyteller sharing them and evolve as popular variations gradually eclipse the previous iteration. Today, of the many versions of Little Red Riding Hood, the general populace typically thinks of the nineteenth-century edition printed by the Grimms, in which a foolish girl and her frail grandmother are rescued by a passing huntsman who cuts them from the wolf's stomach. (Though they tend to leave off the second wolf who follows the young girl and is drowned during an attempted break-in through the chimney.) This was not always the case however.

Folklorists have been saying for several years that it is likely this tale was originally quite different, and was likely a story of a rite of passage for girls as they became women. Angela Carter has this version written out in the back of *The Virago Book of Fairy Tales*, discussing how the girl chooses between the path of needles and path of pins to reach her ailing grandmother. Meanwhile the Wolf takes the shorter path to reach the house and enter using the latched door in order to consume the elder. Red comes along and is told to eat the meat and wine stored in the cupboards- which is actually the blood and flesh of her recently deceased grandmother. The wolf then tells her to strip, throw her clothes into the fire, and join him in bed. The traditional speech of "Oh Grandma, what large X you have" ensues, at the end of which Red realises this is not her dear sickly relative. The protagonist then insists on going to the bathroom, which the Wolf tries to insist she do in the bed, before relenting and tying her to a tree outside to prevent escape. Red gets free and runs to safety, the Wolf realising his mistake too late to catch his prey.

Unlike other classic female figures in fairy tales, I've never had strong feelings about Little Red Riding Hood one way or another. I enjoyed her depiction in *Hoodwinked* and cameo in *Shrek 2;* that was the extent of it. Since I began looking into the story it's been growing on me. There is unfortunately an incredible amount of sexualisation of this young woman (because her depiction does tend to set her at somewhere between childhood and the beginning of adulthood) but otherwise she has agency and motivation.
