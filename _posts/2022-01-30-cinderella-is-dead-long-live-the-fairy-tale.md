Last year I read *Cinderella Is Dead*, a sapphic reimagining of the classic fairy tale. It was not my first sapphic Cinderella or fairy tale reimagining, but it was still enjoyable. It didn't draw me in as many stories do despite my understanding of the choices in the storytelling.

##### The relationships

I am not sapphic, so I cannot judge the romantic relationships in that way, but I can as a reader. And they were frustrating! Homophobia infiltrates every relationship Sophia has, from familial to romantic and everything inbetween. It fits the intensely patriarchal and misogynistic world Bayronn constructs, and does reflect an unfortunately common experience for non-cishet individuals, so its inclusion made sense. But it was so frustrating that it wasn't until she left the society that shunned her that she escaped this. True, it did add to the sense of safety with the love interest, so it makes sense, but not having one relationship in her life she could depend upon was not expected or welcome to me as a reader.

And it took so long for the relationship to get good. The original love interest maddened me. She had internalised that homophobia in a way that it became a weapon against the protagonist, which made me worry they would be the book's OTP. Erin needed to sort herself out and Sophia deserved a relationship where she could be upfront about who she is- something Erin wouldn't and/or couldn't do. The second relationship was better, but took so long to reach because of my second problem with it.

##### The plot and finale

It was long. It took ten chapters to get good. I read it for my dissertation and because I was expecting to enjoy it based on the word-of-mouth I'd heard. The book itself was not a long book, but because I wasn't truly drawn into the romances of the book (the first because of the borderline-toxicity of it, the second because it was so tentative and unsure of itself) it failed to pull me in as others have.  The story itself was enjoyable, it just took to long to hook me. If it had taken another chapter, I may well have DNFd the book.

The story was good. A young girl attempts to bring down a tyrant after living under his dreadful rule and seeing the gruesome death of a close friend and mistreatment of others. She flees to the forest, where she encounters the descendant of Cinderella's stepsister and they travel to find the Fairy Godmother with magic capable of bringing down the King, growing closer as this adventure progresses. This plotline however, was too close to another fairytale story I had read previously- *Enchanted* by Alethea Kontis, for those interested. Though they were based on very different stories, the plan of seeking a fairy godmother to defeat the king while learning to accept yourself and protecting those you care for was too close, especially when the plot twist was that the fairy godmother was helping steal life from women to fuel the immortality of the tyrant.

##### Why I Enjoyed It Despite This

*Cinderella Is Dead* was still a good book. It had a good book with a lovable protagonist you want to succeed. The love interest had an actual character with their own motivation who did not depend  on the protagonist to rescue her or act as only as a conduit for the main character's development.

It was also the contrast against *Ash* that made me realise how much better a lesbian Cinderella could be.
