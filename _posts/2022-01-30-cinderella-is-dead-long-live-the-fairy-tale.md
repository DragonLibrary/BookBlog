Last year I read *Cinderella Is Dead*, a sapphic reimagining of the classic fairy tale. It was not my first sapphic Cinderella or fairy tale reimagining, but it was still enjoyable. It didn't draw me in as many stories do despite my understanding of the choices in the storytelling.

##### The relationships

I am not sapphic, so I cannot judge the romantic relationships in that way, but I can as a reader. And they were frustrating! Homophobia infiltrates every relationship Sophia has, from familial to romantic and everything inbetween. It fits the intensely patriarchal and misogynistic world Bayronn constructs, and does reflect an unfortunately common experience for non-cishet individuals, so its inclusion made sense. But it was so frustrating that it wasn't until she left the society that shunned her that she escaped this. True, it did add to the sense of safety with the love interest, so it makes sense, but not having one relationship in her life she could depend upon was not expected or welcome to me as a reader.

And it took so long for the relationship to get good. The original love interest maddened me. She had internalised that homophobia in a way that it became a weapon against the protagonist, which made me worry they would be the book's OTP. Erin needed to sort herself out and Sophia deserved a relationship where she could be upfront about who she is- something Erin wouldn't and/or couldn't do.
