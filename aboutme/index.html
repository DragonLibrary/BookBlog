<!-- // Pitch // -->
<div class="pitch">

	<p>I’m a publishing student with a passion for fantasy and science-fiction nearing the end of my degree, entering these sectors of trade publishing due to a love of the content and a dedication to coherent, engaging storytelling.</p>
	<p>Sci-fi/fantasy content is among the most interesting in terms of both the range of and creativity behind the stories, as well as the enthusiastic engagement of the audiences. The stories encourage expression and interaction in a way other genres do not, allowing publishers unique opportunities to access and engage the audience (without the stigmas of loneliness or disturbing behaviour crime and romance endure). They also transition between age ranges the easiest, allowing a sliding-scale of target market and content tailoring in all departments and creative avenues. By focusing on these diverse yet identifiable genres there is endless potential for exploration and growth in the content, marketing, and fandom.</p>
	<p>(Coincidentally, these are also the two literary areas most likely to feature dragons, which continue to fascinate me even as an adult.)</p>

<div class="subtitle">
	<p>My Relationship with Books:</p>
	</div>

<div class="info_text">
	<p>As expected, my personal library is primarily fantasy and science-fiction, but contains content ranging from rom-coms to crime thrillers to pop-culture examinations. Because of this, and voracious appetite for books, reading is a major part of my life and influences how I think, act and work.</p>
	<p>The result is an appreciation for specificity in lexicon that serves me well in an assortment of content creation ranging from copywriting to creative writing pieces to marketing plans to business analyses. It also means that careful and exact phrasing is a priority, as intentional communication is the purpose of all writing and speech, especially when it is disseminated beyond the original teller’s sphere of influence.</p>

<div class="subtitle">
	<p>My Skillset:</p>
	</div>
	
<div class="info_text">
	<p>In addition to the aforementioned writing skills, I am also learning code. This page, for example, was edited and curated by me, and I will be enrolling in the #SideProjectSummer program to extend my capabilities until I can be classified as independently competent.</p>
	<p>Alongside this basic proficiency with Adobe, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. The website logo was designed by me and created in these programs.</p>
	<p>These growing technical skills pair with a solid educational foundation thanks to my BA and extra-curricular learning. Aggregating this information has meant an appreciation for and rudimentary knowledge of topics ranging from marketing to publishing to content creation to storytelling to the creative industries and their regulations.</p>
	<p>Combining these with soft skills of prioritisation, enthusiasm, independence and imagination means I have a multi-faceted skillset applicable to a variety of projects, tasks and roles in professional and creative settings.</p>
