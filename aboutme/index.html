<!-- // Pitch // -->
<div class="pitch">

	<p>I’m a publishing student with a passion for fantasy and science-fiction nearing the end of my degree, entering these sectors of trade publishing due to a love of the content and a dedication to coherent, engaging storytelling.</p>
	<p>Sci-fi/fantasy content is among the most interesting in terms of both the range of and creativity behind the stories, as well as the enthusiastic engagement of the audiences. The stories encourage expression and interaction in a way other genres do not, allowing publishers unique opportunities to access and engage the audience (without the stigmas of loneliness or disturbing behaviour crime and romance endure). They also transition between age ranges the easiest, allowing a sliding-scale of target market and content tailoring in all departments and creative avenues. By focusing on these diverse yet identifiable genres there is endless potential for exploration and growth in the content, marketing, and fandom.</p>
	<p>(Coincidentally, these are also the two literary areas most likely to feature dragons, which continue to fascinate me even as an adult.)</p>

	<p>My Relationship with Books:</p>
	</div>

<div class="info_text">
	<p>As expected, my personal library is primarily fantasy and science-fiction, but contains content ranging from rom-coms to crime thrillers to pop-culture examinations. Because of this, and voracious appetite for books, reading is a major part of my life and influences how I think, act and work.</p>
	<p>The result is an appreciation for specificity in lexicon that serves me well in an assortment of content creation ranging from copywriting to creative writing pieces to marketing plans to business analyses. It also means that careful and exact phrasing is a priority, as intentional communication is the purpose of all writing and speech, especially when it is disseminated beyond the original teller’s sphere of influence.</p>
