	<p>Hi! I am university publishing student nearing completion of my undergraduate degree with hopes to enter the trade fiction sector of the industry. This follows a lifetime of passion for storytelling and excitement for literature, resulting in aspirations to enter either children's or science-fiction and fantasy publishing. These audiences are mostly likely to get uninhibitaedly excited about books and the sharing of stories, which is where the joys of books is, and why stories began. To entertain and teach.</p>
	<p>(Coincidentally, these are also the two literary areas most likely to feature dragons, which continue to fascinate me even as an adult.)</p>

	<p>Currently reading Angela Carter's <a class="fact_link" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a7120ed8-cbab-4e04-aa82-5b836844acf4" target="blank"><i>The Bloody Chamber</i></a> and Marina Warner's <a class="fact_link" href="<a class="fact_link" href=" target="blank"><i>Fairy Tale</i></a> for my dissertation. However, a beloved book among my collection is Dianne Wynne Jone's <a class="fact_link" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7db7cf0f-95d0-4a40-970e-5f14393dc499" target="blank"><i>Howl's Moving Castle</i></a>.</p>

	<p>Although I typically read fantasy and sci-fi novels, I am making an effort to broaden my tastes and boost my skill-set through non-fiction books.</p>
