Hello! I am Sammy, and I am the person behind this website. I am a publishing student working to enter trade books and cultivating an interest in certain genres, and creating coherent content on the topics nearest and dearest to the literary parts of me. As a result, most of my content is about fantasy and favourite books in a way that isn't simply reviewing the story.
