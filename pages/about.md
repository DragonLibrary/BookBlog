The *Library of Spilt Ink* is one individual's musings on literature. Primarily (at present) focusing on the meaning behind the cover design of favourite novels and media, this blog aims to explore paratextual choices. At a later date, this may develop into other areas of writing, but for now, let's look at ink-stained covers and the tales lurking within them.

Credit for the logo design goes to the artists at The New Quarterly, whose image from <https://tnq.cadont-let-writers-cry-spilled-ink> was adapted to create the logo for this blog. Changes are pending to avoid infringing on their creative content rights.
