The *Library of Spilt Ink* is one individual's musings on literature. The initial point is on paratextual, especially cover design, choices of content. This is gradually developing to be more in line with science-fiction and fantasy trade books, such as concepts and trends, particular books and opinions on them, and research about fairy tales and associated genres as part of a dissertation. Leaf through the web pages to browse one person's thoughts, and see if they influence yours.
